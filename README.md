# Tab Scribe
## This is a Chrome Extension and will only run as a Chrome Developer Extension because it uses the Chrome Tab API.

## Project Description
### ðŸš€ Save tabs effortlessly, take notes seamlessly!

### ðŸŒŸ Key features:
- Save your favorite websites and articles for later.
- Add notes, insights, or ideas directly to your saved pages.
- Enhance user experience and reduce eye strain by using the Dark Theme option.

### Other features: 
- Modify the state of the note button depending on the note content. If there's no content, the note area collapses, and the note button is shown. If content is inserted, the button disappears, and the note area expands.
- Depending on the note content size, if multiple lines exist, expand the area as necessary to show the entire text.
- By saving more tabs (more than the view size), the page will auto-scroll down to the last tab.
- If note content is added on the last tab, the page will auto-scroll to show the entire card.
